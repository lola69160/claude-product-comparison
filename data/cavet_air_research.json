    ],
    "key_limitations": [
      "Limited climbing power for steep hills (50Nm torque adequate for moderate inclines)",
      "Real-world range of 40-60km vs. claimed 100km (typical for e-bikes)",

    ],
    "price_to_value_assessment": "EUR 1,099 represents good value for a 250W e-bike with quality components (Shimano drivetrain, hydraulic brakes, aluminum frame). Discount from EUR 1,299 adds 15% savings. Competitive positioning in entry-to-mid-range urban e-bike market.",

    "analyst_notes": "CAVET Air is a well-crafted entry-level e-bike with strong comfort positioning. Limited formal reviews may reflect new product status or limited marketing penetration in cycling press. Customer sentiment is overwhelmingly positive (4.2/5 stars) with consistent feedback on comfort, design, and value. The primary limitation appears to be power/torque for hilly terrain, which some users have noted. Recommend collecting additional Reddit community feedback and professional cycling reviews for comprehensive comparison with competitors."
